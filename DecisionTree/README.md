# Decision Tree
In this project, I have implemented famous Algorithm **Decision Tree** as part of my assignment in Data Mining course (B565) at Indiana University under [Prof. Predrag Radivogac](http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~predrag/)   
I have implemented Decision Tree using Python. 
This implementation has the functionality to handle any kind of attributes (Categorical & Numerical).I have also implemented Pruning Algorithm to keep a check on complexity of Decision Tree.   

###Steps to Execute the Algorithm:
