#Q3

###A)  
Please find the code for both $F_{k-1} X F_{k-1}$ and $F_{k-1} X F_1$.  
[Module:aprioriGn.py](./Code/aprioriGen.py)  

I maintained counter for count of candidate itemsets and count of frequent itemsets in actual **apriori** code which can be seen here  
[Module:apriori.py](./Code/apriori.py)  

Instructions to run the code can be seen in the attached readme.md file.  

###B)  
In this problem i took up datasets from UCI repository which were categorical,numerical or both and correspondingly binarized the  datasets removing redundant columns.I implemented binarization function in R.  
[Module:binarization.r](./Code/binarization.rmd)

[Dataset 1:Car Evaluation]("https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Car+Evaluation")  

This is completely categorical dataset with dimension $1728 * 7$. After removing some redundant columns i binarized this dataset and converted into  csv file.(This binarized file can be seen as binarize_car.csv in ./Data/Car folder).  
After executing apriori code on this dataset using the two candidate generation methods i got following results for three different threshold values of support.  

$F_{k-1} X F_{k-1}$ 

| support | candidate_itemsets | frequent_itemsets |
|---------|--------------------|-------------------|
| 0.01    | 190                | 84                |
